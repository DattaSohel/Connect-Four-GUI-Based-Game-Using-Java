# Connect-Four-GUI-Based-Game-Using-Java

The Connect 4 game is a classic two-player board game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid.

The objective is to be the first to connect four of one's own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

This project aims to create a digital version of Connect 4 using Java, allowing players to enjoy the game on their computers.

Objectives
Develop an interactive and user-friendly Connect 4 game.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
