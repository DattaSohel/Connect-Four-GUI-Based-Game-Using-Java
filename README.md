# Connect-Four-GUI-Based-Game-Using-Java

The Connect 4 game is a classic two-player board game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid.

The objective is to be the first to connect four of one's own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

This project aims to create a digital version of Connect 4 using Java, allowing players to enjoy the game on their computers.

<h3><b>Objectives: </h3></b>

1. Develop an interactive and user-friendly Connect 4 game.
2. Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
3. Allow two players to compete against each other.
4. Include features such as resetting the game, displaying scores, and highlighting winning connections.

<h3><b>Key Features:</b></h3>

1. Game Board: A 7-column by 6-row grid where players can drop their discs.
2. Player Turns: Alternating turns between two players (Player 1 and Player 2).
3. Winning Conditions: Check for four consecutive discs in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
4. Game Reset: Option to reset the game after a win or draw.
5. Score Tracking: Display scores for each player and keep track of wins.

<h3><b>Technical Requirements:</b></h3>

a. Programming Language: Java
b. Development Environment: Any IDE that supports Java (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
c. Libraries Used: Java Swing for GUI components.

 <h3><b>Implementation Steps:</b></h3>

1. Set Up the Project: Create a new Java project in the chosen IDE.
2. Design the Game Board: Use a 2D array to represent the grid and initialize it with empty values.
3. Create GUI Components:
                        <br>a. Use JFrame for the main window.
                        <br>b. Use JPanel to represent the game board.
                        <br>c. Add buttons for each column where players can drop their discs.
4. Implement Game LogicL
   i. Write methods to handle player turns, check for winning conditions, and reset the game.

5. Test the Game: Ensure all features work as intended and fix any bugs.
